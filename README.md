## 📖 Documentation

### 🏗️ System Architecture
![system architecture](project_ss_send/sys.png)

### 🔧 Configuration

The system can be configured by modifying parameters in `video_processor.py`:

```python
# Speed detection parameters
self.speed_limit = 100  # km/h overspeed threshold
self.meters_between_lines = 8  # Distance between ROC lines
self.vehicle_classes = [2, 3, 5, 7]  # car, motorcycle, bus, truck
```

### 📊 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Homepage |
| `/upload/` | GET/POST | Video upload |
| `/dashboard/` | GET | User dashboard |
| `/process/<id>/` | POST | Process video |
| `/video/<id>/` | GET | Video details |

---

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Video Processing

```python
from speed_detection.video_processor import VehicleSpeedDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = VehicleSpeedDetector()

# Process video
detection_count = detector.process_video(
    input_path="traffic_video.mp4",
    output_path="processed_video.mp4",
    csv_path="results.csv"
)

print(f"Detected {detection_count} vehicles")
```

### Custom Calibration

```python
# Set up video-specific calibration
calibration_data = {
    "video_name.mp4": {
        "pixels_per_meter": 12.0,
        "roc_line_1": 0.35,
        "roc_line_2": 0.65
    }
}
```
